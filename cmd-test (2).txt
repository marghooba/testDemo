Acceptance Letter Sample

Manager of Human Resources

Dear Ms. Nelson:
I am writing to confirm my acceptance of your employment offer on April 20 and to tell you how
delighted I am to be joining XYZ Corporation in Chicago. The work is exactly what I have
prepared to perform and hoped to do. I feel confident that I can make a significant contribution to
the corporation, and I am grateful for the opportunity you have given me.
As we discussed, I will report to work at 8:00 am on July 1 and will have completed the medical
examination and drug testing by the start date. Additionally, I shall complete all employment and
insurance forms for the new employee orientation.
I look forward to working with you and your fine team. I appreciate your confidence in me and
am very happy to be joining your staff.
Sincerely, 

I think this problem of automatic phone restarting can be due to the following reasons :

- Your phone's battery has got damaged or has become faulty..
- Your phone got affected by viruses 
- Your phone's software got corrupted
- There is no much free space in the phone's memory 

For this problem try the following steps to solve the problem :

- first replace your battery with the other battery and then try to use the phne ..If it works fine then you have to just buy a new battery for your phone ..
- Scan your phone for any viruses or malwares and install antivirus in it ..
- Reset and update your phone with the new software
- Free up the internal memory of phone and then use the phone

Q: when you have to use abstract class and interface?

I use interfaces when I see that something in my design will change frequentlyFor example, the Strategy pattern lets you swap new algorithms and processes into your program without altering the objects that use them. A media player might know how to play CDs, MP3s, and wav files. Of course, you don't want to hardcode those playback algorithms into the player; that will make it difficult to add a new format like AVI. Furthermore, your code will be littered with useless case statements. And to add insult to injury, you will need to update those case statements each time you add a new algorithm. All in all, this is not a very object-oriented way to program. 

With the Strategy pattern, you can simply encapsulate the algorithm behind an object. If you do that, you can provide new media plug-ins at any time. Let's call the plug-in class MediaStrategy. That object would have one method: playStream(Stream s). So to add a new algorithm, we simply extend our algorithm class. Now, when the program encounters the new media type, it simply delegates the playing of the stream to our media strategy. Of course, you'll need some plumbing to properly instantiate the algorithm strategies you will need. 

This is an excellent place to use an interface. We've used the Strategy pattern, which clearly indicates a place in the design that will change. Thus, you should define the strategy as an interface. You should generally favor interfaces over inheritance when you want an object to have a certain type; in this case, MediaStrategy. Relying on inheritance for type identity is dangerous; it locks you into a particular inheritance hierarchy. Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance, so you can't extend something that gives you a useful implementation or more type identity. 



Abstract classes are excellent candidates inside of application frameworks 
Abstract classes let you define some behaviors; they force your subclasses to provide others. For example, if you have an application framework, an abstract class may provide default services such as event and message handling. Those services allow your application to plug in to your application framework. However, there is some application-specific functionality that only your application can perform. Such functionality might include startup and shutdown tasks, which are often application-dependent. So instead of trying to define that behavior itself, the abstract base class can declare abstract shutdown and startup methods. The base class knows that it needs those methods, but an abstract class lets your class admit that it doesn't know how to perform those actions; it only knows that it must initiate the actions. When it is time to start up, the abstract class can call the startup method. When the base class calls this method, Java calls the method defined by the child class

Hi Mike,

My efforts bore fruit with the successful completion of this project. Working with you has been a reward indeed. However, there are many others who share the reward of this effort simply because it would never have been this good without their help. I acknowledge the cooperation, encouragement and austerity of our manager, Mr. Santosh kumar CH & Mr. Vijayaraghavan S, whose guidance did half the magic of keeping me thrilled throughout this project.
I would like to express my gratitude towards the organisation team for making me a part of this wonderful family.

Hi Amex team,

Actually wanted to inform you that, last month i was out of station however couldn't make a payment on time. it seems payment done after 2 days of due date. this was the first time  happened with me. please you can check my previous history as well. But this time again when i was planning to make payment then i saw again i missed due date due to date changed. Normally i used to make payment on 28/29 every month but this time howcome 26.

if this is the case then american express team should send me the payment reminder. sorry for the late payment but my request is to don't include the late charges becuse i really wanted to use the card orelse i need to discontinue.

Please do the needfull and let me know the status.

Card number : 3798 618282 81004

thank you for considering me for the appraisal. there was a healthy discussion in one to one, and think that my appraisal should be reevaluated, as i am feeling that it has not meet my expectation.

The quality of work i delivered and handle the project, i am feeling that it doesnt match with that. Since 2years i am asking for the promotion, but i am not getting any solid reason for stoping it. if 
there is any eligiblilty criterai or any process for that, Please let me know.

Load testing:

1. msx load the application is able to hold
2. how much data the database handle befor system slow or crash.
3. network related issue to be addressed?

Strees testing:

What is the max load a system can sustain before it breaks down?
How is the system break down?
Is the system able to recover once itís crashed?
In how many ways system can break and which are the weak node while handling the unexpected load?

How does Functional Testing differ from Performance Testing?

Upcoming trends for software testing 

1. Open source tools will arise.

Open source tools are going to rule the software testing industry in the coming years as businesses are going to use them for better performance in terms of Agile, DevOps (development & operations) and test automation. As a result, the groups that support open source tools are going to be more active and involved.

2. Demand for quality at high speed will increase.

High-quality products in the fastest possible time will be the need of the hour. As a result, businesses will be forced to raise their product standards so that they can deliver the best user experience within the shortest amount of time. This will inevitably be mostly done by more advanced automation. High-quality scripts in on the rise and showing no sign of slowing down.

3. Demand for software development engineers in testing (SDETs) will rise.

Though SDETs have been here for a long time, their role was different from that of traditional testing. However, in the years to come, the test automation field is going to have a huge demand, due to which more testers will have to take up the role of SDETs to be successful.

4. Agile and DevOps will dominate.

Test automation developers will migrate into agile teams if they haven't already. Also, traditional testing is showing an inclination towards QA engineering. Testing is expected to become more iterative, progressive and integrated with development in the coming years. Also, software development will be in accordance with testing.

5. Big data testing will be of great importance.

We deal with a huge amount of big data today and, therefore, big data testing needs to have a very strong strategy. Dataset testing requires various updated analytical tools, techniques, and frameworks and is an area that is expected to grow big in the very near future.

6. Performance testing will give way for performance engineering.

The success of different platforms, operating systems (OSs), and devices depends on the quality of user experience they provide. Demand for best user experience is forcing businesses to change their tactics. As a result, they are shifting their focus from performance tests to performance engineering.

7. Internet of Things (IoT) testing will grow.

With IoT on the rise, customers expect products to be the best, especially in terms of their functionality, security, and effectiveness before they use them. All devices under IoT requires Internet connectivity and, therefore, are vulnerable to security risks. It is necessary to perform IoT testing on them. According to a study by HP, 70% of devices in IoT are prone to security risks.

8. Digital testing will soar.

Almost all organizations have begun the digital transformation. Their focus these days is mainly on delivering products to the market in the shortest time possible, giving special attention to QA and testing. Therefore, the digital strategy of these organizations must involve optimizing functional testing across all channels.

9. Quality engineering will become prominent with DevOps.

DevOps recommends alliance between businesses, developers, and IT professionals. With DevOps, testing has an important role to play as developers participate in the testing process and the net quality engineering aspects. As faster deployment and QA are possible for even the most complex IT systems today, enterprises will find it easier to deliver high-quality products in a quick, cost-efficient manner.

10. Software testing budgets will keep growing.

With the huge demand for high-quality products within a short time span, the role of testing has grown beyond just another process. As a result, businesses are allotting approximately 40% of their IT budget for software testing and QA.

 

 As 2018 sets in ñ I wanted to share with you some of the focus areas that we should be all working towards and make sure we all have an understanding of the overarching goals of the Testing Practice which is relevant at all levels and I would urge each one of you to ensure this is the basis of all our planning and execution moving forward.
1.	Retool (Reskilling  of  the team) ñ Based on the benchmark skill assessment done 6 months ago ñ the prime focus of the team is to bring in ìAutomation as a Cultureî in all the initiatives, projects that we undertake. Manual testing while important isnít the only skills we can go with beyond a certain level.
2.	Shorter Delivery Cycles (Testing Cycles) ñ Enhanced focus on CI/CD/CT and to begin with ensuring each person has the skill to ìuseî automation framework ñ no necessarily design one. Here on Functional Automation, Security and Performance testing needs to be an internal deliverable (even if the client doesnít scope it out)
3.	Productivity and Efficiency ñ this will warrant us to have more robust task allocation, monitoring and tracking measures in place. The core objective being do more with less Ö. Across the board we should do more with smaller specialized teams
4.	Learning and Development in line with each role and more enhanced focus on external certifications/courses (in consultation with your managers/mentors)
5.	Enhanced focus in AI/ML ñ for optimized  generation of test cases, test scripts, test data, and in maintaining and reusing test scripts. 
6.	Focus on building SDET (cross platform) team that is ready to take on any new/upcoming assignments
7.	Accountability at all levels
8.	Hands-on ñ Pure ìpeople managementî, ìQA managementî while important - alone cannot be a skill that would take us to the next level ñ hence it is imperative we upgrade ourselves and make ourselves relevant to the needs of the market
The ask from each one of you is to put together a Plan on how you will accomplish these objectives in the next 3 months, 6 months and beyond at individual and project level as may be applicable. Let us have the first cut plan by Monday 22nd January.

Iíd like to talk about what the next step in my career looks like. Iíd really like it to be with this organization, but the next steps here arenít completely clear to me.
I'm excited to share my plan which will accomplish objectives in the 6 months individual and project level as well.
 
1. Reskilling of the team already started and we are doing individual technical evaluation [Java/Selenium] accross different projects. Our prime goal of the team is to convert all intersted manual tester to automation.
   To achive goal need to implement 
	   -> sortlist the skills and evaluate [Individual/Teams]
	   -> For right skills will provide the technical tranining  
   
   Folloinwg steps need to follow in order to increase automation across projects
	-> Understand project requirements thoroughly - a deep understanding of project requirements such as project type (web/desktop/mobile), scope of the project, and team strength on code language before start the automation. 
	-> Right automation tool need to choose based on businees requirements.
	-> Development & maintenance of test scripts should be as simple as possible to decrease the human and time resource utilization.
	-> The test suite execution should be simple for any project member to run them easily as and when required.
	-> Also, it should be easy for manual testers who have very little or no technical knowledge.
	-> Support to Cross browser testing is a must when there are multiple end-users and no particular browser restriction.
	-> Keyword driven testing acts as an extension to the data driven testing framework. When a project becomes complex, test framework needs to be extended.
	-> Automation Engineers definitely need help while handling critical problems of a project. The tool that provides technical support and assistance would be of great help.

2. Testing Cycles - our main focus should be deliver quality, for best quality need to improve QA process. However, QA managers and testers should follow following points 

Points for Leads, Test Managers, Project Managers and Delivery Heads:

-> Identify all the platforms on which application will be run.
-> Improve requirements management process ñ business & functional requirements should be well documented. Involve testing team in requirement gathering phase.
-> Create a document / list of all possible scenarios before writing test cases. Include it into test planning.
-> Measure testing effort on periodical basis ñ New Bug Rate, Effort Variance, Schedule Variance, Test Case Effectiveness, Residual defect density etc.
-> Keep developers away from test environments.
-> Post mortem meetings must be planned after every release. Both testing & development teams should participate in these meetings.
-> Keep track of bug fixing time taken by development team. Keep informed about the time remaining for regression testing to relevant stack holders. Tracking of this point by relevant stack holders is very critical as it may result in low quality releases.

Points for Software Testers:

-> Try to understand the logic behind the screen and try to break that logic. Understand the internal workings of code from developers during lunch time or tea breaks.
-> Analyse test results thoroughly. Try to identify root cause from functional perspective.
-> Break the application into smaller functional modules.
-> First write test cases for valid conditions, then cover invalid conditions.
-> While writing test cases, refer design documents as well.
-> As soon as you complete the test case writing, share test case with development team. It could result in time saving.
-> During test case writing phase, group test cases using impact analysis. It will help in effective regression testing in less time.
-> If you are new tester for a old development team, have a look on old bug reports of modules / project where development worked previously. Generally developers, repeat similar mistakes.
-> Test the application for both implicit as well as explicit requirements.
-> Never communicate bugs verbally. For any critical / show stopper bugs, have an immediate discussion & then document via mail and share it to relevant stack holders.
   


 
based on the weíve discussed, what ideas do you have about what my next step here could be?î

At the onset let me wish you all a Very Happy New Year and thank you for all your contributions towards your assignment, project, organization, practice as may be applicable for each one of us.

2017 was crucial in many ways ñ Forrester recognized us as a preferred Software Testing Vendor in 2 consecutive reports ñ ìVendor Landscape: Continuous Testing Servicesî, ëForrester Wave Reportî.
These reports have  a 33+-criteria evaluation of the various offerings of each testing vendor and then lists the top 10-20 of those highlighting the key areas of strength. Needless to say this is an independent assessment and a tough competition to even have a mention in the reports. 

We also saw multiple, consistent , successful deliveries in all our projects in the CL, Media, After Market(SOPs) verticals & IST Horizontal. Test Execution, Delivery and Rollout in some of these was challenging both Technically and Operationally but the team did a great job in ensuring success. 

As 2018 sets in ñ I wanted to share with you some of the focus areas that we should be all working towards and make sure we all have an understanding of the overarching goals of the Testing Practice which is relevant at all levels and I would urge each one of you to ensure this is the basis of all our planning and execution moving forward.

1.	Retool (Reskilling  of  the team) ñ Based on the benchmark skill assessment done 6 months ago ñ the prime focus of the team is to bring in ìAutomation as a Cultureî in all the initiatives, projects that we undertake.

The ask from each one of you is to put together a Plan on how you will accomplish these objectives in the next 3 months, 6 months and beyond at individual and project level as may be applicable. Let us have the first cut plan by Monday 22nd January.

Sreeja PM, Vinod Varughese  from the practice leadership team along with Santosh CH (Functional Test Automation) ; Sowmya C/Gajinder Pal Singh ñ (CL/Products) ; Chidananda S ñ (After Market (SOPs)) ;Vinay Agarwalñ (Media/Retail/All projects at Noida); Swati Shrivastava ñ (QA Process/ Practices/Gates) ; Keshava Murthy ñ (NFR) will drive this entire initiative towards completion. 


Let us meet and discuss next week and answer any queries that you may have.


1. Analyze your existing test cases, see if there is any double-handling / overlapping.
2. Break down your manual test cases into groups based on their priority and likelihood of being executed, always execute test cases with high priority first.
3. Break down large test cases into smaller ones
4. Review your test cases after each test cycle, if there are test cases that are not catching bugs, down-grade their priority and after a while, eventually remove them

1. Create test plan that will cover core functionalities and make sure that this plan doesn't take more than half an hour to perform/execute, with these cases you will make sure that main functionalities are working properly.

2. Divide cases into several modules and if development team is performing fixes, change requests or some alteration in code you will be able to quickly run test that are only affected by latest change.

3. Create regression test that will go through all functionalities but without using edge cases, this test should be performed when there is time to check global project, but should be used as a best case scenario where you expect that everything works

1. Prioritize. 
2. Identify the core 20% test cases which covers the 80% base functionality. 
3. Remove redundants:Identify reduntant test cases/ test steps throughout the test suite.


Why Automation?
Automation can be chosen only when:

The application has a very vast area with a high degree of investing effort in regression.
Optimization in costs occurred due to manual errors.
The software has multiple versions and releases.
It is cost effective in long run.
The risk factor is higher for a broader scope of test execution.
Cost figures and mathematical calculations are included in the software functionality.
There is a greater increase in the execution tempo, efficiency along with the software quality.
There is a lesser turn around time, even for high-risk software testing.

-> Prioritize - Break down manual test cases into groups based on their priority and being executed, always execute test cases with high priority first.
-> Identify the core 20% test cases which covers the 80% base functionality. 
-> Analyze existing test cases, see if there is any double-handling/overlapping.
-> Break down large test cases into smaller ones
-> Review test cases after each test cycle/build, if there are test cases that are not catching bugs, down-grade their priority or remove them
-> Create regression test that will go through all functionalities
-> Test with developers side by side, making sure requirements are tested as the product is getting developed to reduce show-stoppers at the end.
-> All regrssion test case should be automate in order to reduce testing time and effort.

2.	How to increase automation across Projects

Folloinwg steps need to follow in order to increase automation across projects
-> Understand project requirements thoroughly - a deep understanding of project requirements such as project type (web/desktop/mobile), scope of the project, and team strength on code language before start the automation. 
-> Right automation tool need to choose based on businees requirements.
-> Development & maintenance of test scripts should be as simple as possible to decrease the human and time resource utilization.
-> The test suite execution should be simple for any project member to run them easily as and when required.
-> Also, it should be easy for manual testers who have very little or no technical knowledge.
-> Support to Cross browser testing is a must when there are multiple end-users and no particular browser restriction.
-> Keyword driven testing acts as an extension to the data driven testing framework. When a project becomes complex, test framework needs to be extended.
-> Automation Engineers definitely need help while handling critical problems of a project. The tool that provides technical support and assistance would be of great help.


QA process improvment

QA automation process:
-> Break down the major funcationality
-> Identify the common scenarios and automate 
-> Generate the automation reports in html format.
